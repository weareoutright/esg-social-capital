					School districts likely already have many of the foundational pieces
					in place for helping students build social capital. These might
					include current strategies around work-based learning, important
					partnerships with employers and postsecondary institutions, or
					advising plans to guide students in their next step. However, these
					strategies often lack a high-level coordinating vision, intentional
					design planning, progress monitoring, and evaluation to ensure that
					all students are benefiting from these critical relationship-building
					experiences.
