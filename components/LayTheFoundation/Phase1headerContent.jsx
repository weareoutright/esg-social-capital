        <p className='content-justify'>School districts likely already have many of the foundational pieces in place for helping students build social capital. These might include current strategies around work-based learning, important partnerships with employers and postsecondary institutions, or advising plans to guide students in their next step. However, these strategies often lack a high-level coordinating vision, intentional design planning, progress monitoring, and evaluation to ensure that all students are benefiting from these critical relationship-building experiences.
