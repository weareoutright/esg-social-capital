        <p className='content-justify'>Communities must have a clear system of program elements addressing social capital in order to ensure their vision becomes a reality for their students. Once a community has developed a theory of action and better understands their current assets, they can narrow in on where current practices could be enhanced or strengthened with social capital development strategies, tools, or resources. Leveraging existing programs, resources, and infrastructures in this work ensures alignment and sustainability long-term and reduces the chances that staff with limited capacity see this as an additional burden. There are also a host of organizations and comprehensive programs available for purchase that can help fill in gaps.
